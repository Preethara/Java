We use the integers , , and  to create the following series:

(a + 2^0 * b, a + 2^0  b + 2^1 * b,........... a + 2^(n-1) * b)

You are given  queries in the form of , , and . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given , , and  values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective , , and  values for that query.

Constraints

0 <= q <= 500
0 <= a,b <= 50
1 <= n <= 15

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5
Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
Explanation

We have two queries:

We use a = 0,b = 2  and n = 10  to produce some series s0,s1,s2,......sn-1:
s0 = 0 + 1.2 = 2
s1 = 0 + 1.2 + 2.2 = 6
... and so on.

Once we hit n = 10, we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

We use a = 5 , b = 3 , and n = 5  to produce some series s0,s,s2,.......sn-1:

We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.
